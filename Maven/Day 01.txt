Module 2: DevOps Overview
Module 3: DevOps on Cloud (last 2 days)
Module 4: Build Tool - Maven

MAVEN

1. Maven is a build tool that is used to create the initial project folder structure to develop the source code of the application - Developers POV
2. Maven is used to build the application - DevOps Engineers POV
3. Based on different programming languages, we have different build tools
	Java		- Maven
	Python		- PyBuilder
	Ruby		- Rakes
	.net			- MS Builder
				- Ant, Gradle...
4. Developers will write the source code of the application... (.java) ----> compile the source code ----> we will do using Maven
5. Maven is used for the projects which are developed by using JPL
6. Maven is also called as Java Build Tool
7. If you want to work with Maven, we need to install and setup Java
8. Maven is an open-source s/w and it is available for FREE of cost

-----------------------------------------
=> Features of Maven
-----------------------------------------
1. Maven is used to create the initial project folder structure 

2. Using Maven we can download the dependencies that are required to develop the project
Dependency?
	House ----> Bricks ----> Steel, Sand, Water... (Dependencies)
	Netflix ----> Java ----> Spring, SpringBoot... (Dependencies)
How to download the dependencies?
	Before Maven, developers used to download and install all these dependencies in their local system
How Maven will download the dependencies?
	All the dependencies that are required for the project will be configured in a file which is known as "pom.xml"
	POM - Project Object Model
From where we have to get the dependencies?
	mvnrepository.com

3. Using Maven we can compile the source code of the application
	.java (Source code of the application - Human Readable Language) -----> .class (Machine Understandable Language)
	The process of converting the .java files into .class files is known as Compilation
	Using Maven we can do the compilation
	Once we get the .class file we can then execute the code and then we can see the output
	If you want to see the output, java has to be installed

			Compile			Execute
	.java ------------------> .class ------------------> JVM ------------------> Output


4. 50 .java files -----> 50 .class files
When we have multiple .java files, using Maven we can package all the .java files.
Once after packaging, we can directly compile them
When we package we will get artifacts
Artifacts will have different extensions based on the type of application
	1. Standalone Applications		- .jar (Java Archive)
	2. Web Applications			- .war (Web Archive)
	3. Enterprise Applications		- .ear (Enterprise Archive)

Maven is developed by using JPL
Maven is developed by Apache Organization
